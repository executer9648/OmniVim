# My-Vim-With-Ahk
This repository contains libraries from several sources 
I have only combined useful functionality from them to create this vim/emacs script.

Links to sources:

[AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/scripts/index.htm) website

[Axelfublr](https://github.com/Axlefublr/lib-v2) - his repo also contains libraries from other sources:
